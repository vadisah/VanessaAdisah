  <h2>Professional Events</h2>
  <p>
  I recently participated in <a href="https://www.soarintodata.com/" target="_blank">Soar Into Data 2025</a>, where I collaborated with a team to tackle the Chatbot Arena Predictions challenge. We explored how machine learning can be used to predict which chatbot response a user would prefer — an effort that deepened my interest in NLP and human-centered AI. It was an inspiring experience to grow alongside brilliant business analyst while building tools that support more intuitive, responsive AI systems.
